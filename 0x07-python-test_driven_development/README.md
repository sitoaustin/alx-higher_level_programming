# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
I learned how to write tests for Python programs as part of this project. Writing tests is essentially a solid foundation for flexible and scalable applications. I discovered that tests are written to ensure that the program behaves as expected.

Procedure followed to write tests:

* Write test that'll fail
* Then write the program code
* Then test your program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail
* Then write correct tests
* Then test your code
* Then write more codes
* Then write more tests
* The main thing here is that test driven development eradicates fear of making mistakes while coding. You should also start by writing failing tests before writing correct test. Run the test code as you continue to write your application.
